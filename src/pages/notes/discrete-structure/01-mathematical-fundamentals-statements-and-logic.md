# Variables

**Normal**: No matter what number might be if it is greater than 2, then its square is greater than 4  
**With Variables**: No matter what number $x$ might be chosen, if $x$ is greater than 2, then $x$ squared is greater than 4  
**Math Form**: $\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}, x > 2 \rightarrow x^2 > 4$

# Mathematical Statements

**Universal Statement**: certain property is true for all in a set

- Ex. All positive number are greater than 0

**Conditional Statement**: If one thing is true, then some other thing is also true.

- Ex. If 8 is divisible by 4, then 8 is divisible by 2

**Existential Statement**: Given a property that may or may not be true, there exist at least one thing for which that property is true

- Ex. There is a prime number that is even (2)

**Universal Conditional Statement**: Statement that are both universal and conditional

**Universal Existential Statement**: Some properties is true for object for a given type asserts the existance of something ($\forall x\exists y$)

**Existential Universal Statement**: Certain object exists that satisfies for a certian property for all type of certian kinds ($\exists x \forall y$)

# Sets

**Defn**: **unordered** collection of **distinct** elements.

- Ex. $\{ x | x \text{ is an even integer} \}$

# Logic

**Proposition**: a statment that is either true or false

# Predicate Logic

**Predicate**: proposition whose truth depends on the vlaue of the variable
