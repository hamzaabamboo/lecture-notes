# What is Astronomy

- Understanding the "lights" that wee see in the sky

## The sky inspire ideas of...

- Mistery
- Respect
- Amazement
- Immensity
- Immutability

## Astronomy is connected to...

- **Cosmology** - Describing the Universe as a whole
- **Mathematics** - Using abstraction and reasoning on problems of measurement and calculation
- **Physics** - Describing the phenomenon that occur in nature
- **Philosopy** - Trying to find answers to profound questions
- **Religion** - Organizing our belief about transcendental matters
- **Astrology** - Trying to find effects of the celestial bodies in our lives and to predict the future

# Periods

## "Ancient" Age ( until 16<sup>th</sup> century ) / the Geometrical Period

- no big change in anything / slow development

## "Modern" Age (16<sup>th</sup> - 19<sup>th</sup> century) / the Dynamical Period

- Scientists start learning dynamics
- More connection between subjects

# Astronomy as a science

- New Observation -> New Instruments for better Observation
- New Observation -> New Questions
- New Observation -> New Applications
- New Observation -> Answers questions, Have to make sense compared to observation
- People 
- Experiments ? -> Normally means proving the model

# Instruments

## The Naked Eye

- Available Since: always
- Observations possible:
  - The sun and Moon
  - Stars: about 1000
  - Planets: 5
  - Comets
  - Other "nebulous" object: less than 20
  - The "Milky Way"

# Observations

## The Sun and the Moon

- Instrument required: naked eye
- First Observed: prehistory
- Conclusions:
  - Sun produces day/night
  - Moon has phases with consistant period (month) Day/night duratoin related to seasons (year)

## Stars and planets

- Instrument required: naked eye
- First observed: prehisory
- Conclusions:
  - Stars do not change position with respect to other star
  - Planets change position continuously

## The Milky Way

- Instrument required: naked eye
- First Observed: prehistory
- A slightly brighter stripe in the sky
- Visible only during very dark nights.
- Conclusions

## Eclipses

- Instrument required: naked eye
- First observed: Prehistory
- Solar: the sun gets dark !
- Llunar: the full moon gets dark
- Happend not frequently
- Conclusions: varied

# Applications

## The Sun dial

- Observaiton Needed: Sun
- First time used: prehistory
- Important Examples: Egyptians, Babylonian
- Helps measure time of days

## The Calendar

- Observations needed: Sun and Moon
- First time used: prehistory
- Important Examples: Sumerian, Mayans, Greeks..
- Helps measure long time periods and predict seasons

## The Astrolabe

- Observations needed: Sun, Moon, stars, planets
- First time used: 200BC
- "Analog Calculator"
- Helps locate and predict positoins of astronomical bodies; calculate geographic position and local time 
- Useful for nagivation  and astronomical studies.

## Retrogade Motion

- Derived from obeervation of planets
- Planets move in the same direction most of the time
- For some time, they move in th eopposite direciton


# Questions

## How far is..? / How big is ..?

- Main problem in Astronomy
  - How far are Moon, Sun, planets, stars ?
  - How big or bright are they ?
- Distance can be known if real brightness or size is known, and vice versa
- Answers:
  - Moon and Sun: Use observations of eclipse, trigonometry ( Aristarchus of Samus, Hippachus, 3rd and 2nd centuries BC)
  - Planets: guessed, but not measured until the 17th century
  - Stars: impossible to determine until the 10th century !

# Models

## Geocentric Universe

- The earth is at the center
- Sun, Moon, and planets are fied to spheres of differnet sizes that rotate at different paces.
- Stars are fixed to an otuer space
- Inportant contributors
  - Plato, Aristotle, Euxoxious of Cradus ( 4th Century BC)
  - Ptolemy (2nd Century AD): epicycles

## Epicycles

- "Circles within circles"
- Needed to explain retrograde motion
- First proposed by Apollonius of Perga ( 3rd century BC)
- Formalized by Ptolemy (2nd century AD)

# Ptolemy

- Lived: 90 - 168
- Developed a precise model to calculate and predict positions of planets
  - Geocentric model
  - Presented in convenient tables
  - Accepted model in the West for 1,400 years afterwards
