# Key Word / Concepts

## Paradigm

model / point of view / framework /midset

## Anomaly

a result that was unexpected in the current paradigm

## Crisis

a feeling the scientific community that the paradigm is no longer valid

## Revolution

the scientific community turns to a new paradigm.

# Correct / Incorrect vs Scientific / Unscientific ( Ch.1 )

## Is a theory correct ?

- Every theory has a limited score
- "Correct" = consistent with **present-day** obersvations experiments within its scope
- Thus"correctness" can change with time"

## Is a theory scientific ?

- "Scientific" = a logical explanation of a phenomenon in nature
- Ideally, should be **falseifiable**
- Defined in its historical context, and does not change with time

# Evolution of a discipline ( Ch.2 )

## Example: Evolution of ideas in mechanics

| No paradigm | Aristotle | Newton   | Einsteing | ??? |
| ----------- | --------- | -------- | --------- | --- |
| -           | paradigm  | paradigm | paradigm  | -   |

Example: The Newtonian paradigm was $F = ma, F_{12} = -F_{21}$

Example: Einstein's Special Relativity

## When there is no paradigm yet ...
    
Kuhn believed that a discipline at that stage is not yet mature, and he found that different reseach groups tend to have incompativle viewpoints.
They do not yet have a common viewpoint or mindset (,e, a common paradigm) that is accepted by all groups, which is an obstacle to further progess in the field

## Example of pre-paradigm science: Electricity

### 1700-1750: Different groups had different views...

1. Interested in charging by friction and attraction .. but not interested in conduction
2. Interested in attraction and repultion.... but unable to explain conduction
3. Fluid model of conduction... but unable to eplain attraction or repulsion

### Obstacles to progress during a pre-paradigm period

- Each group stresses the explanation of different phenomena.
- This results of experiments can be intepreted differently.
- Thiere is no paradigm to point the way to further experiments that would provide useful tests or refinements of their understanding.

# Paradigm in different disciplines

- Astronomy: motion of stars in the sky (ancient times)
  - Ptolemy: planets & Sun orbit earth ( ~140 A.D.)
  - Copernicus: palnets & Earth orbit Sun ( 1543)
- Mathematics (ancient times)
- Mechanics: Aristotle(~370 B.C.), Newton(1687) , Einstein (1905)
- Optics: Newton (1675), Young (1802), Einstein(1905)
- Electricity: Franklin(1751), Coulomb (1785), Thomson: discovery of the election (1899)
- Populations: Mathus(1798), demographic transition(1929)
- Evolution: Darwin / Wallace (1858)
- Medicine: Pasteur ?Koch: germ theory of disease (1876)
- Heredity: Mendal (1860; disseminated in 1900), DNA & the genetic code (Structure by Watson & Crick, 1953)
- Sociology: no paradigm yet ! Ideas: ration choice, instinctive behavior, conflict theory (including marxism)

# Normal science and Paradigm (ch.3)

## The role of a paradigm
- Standard ideas / views -> helps scientists communicate with each other
- Falsifiabliity: The paradigm can prdict expected results from observations /experiments. if the prediction is incorrect. this may indicate that **some or all of the paradigm is incorrect** and needs to be modified
- Points the way to further observations /experiments
- a paradigm is not complete at first. it is a skeleton that needs to be developed into a complete theory
- When Kuhn calls "normal science" is theory computation /experiments/ observations to improve our understanding of nature **within the Framework of the current paradigm.**
- Research results are interpreted **within that paradigm**
  - Good Point: This helps to organize many results.
  - Bad Point: We may overlook new phenomena that are not expected within th eparadigm
- This is the main job of a scientist: Normal science to improve upon existing knowledge (the paradigm)

# The role of textbooks
- Explain the viewpoint of the **current paradigm**
- Teach the stages and evolution of the discipline. **only** with regard to the origins of the current paradigm, **stressing what is correct or incorrect according to our current knowledge.**
- Can lead to misunderstanding of the history of science.
- In any case, textbooks are **highly efficient** at prudcing young scientists who are skilled at problem solving and research in the framework of the current paradigm

# Normal science and puzzle solving

- Like crossword puzzles and jizsaw puzzles
- A key motivation for scientists: We enjoy solving puzzles
- Normal Science is carried out in the framework of the current paradigm and clear "rules of the game." just like a puzzle.
- When Kuhn refers to "rules." he means the **scientific methodology**

## Do the "rules" play a role in he evolution of a discipline similar to paradigm

No - Kuhn provide smany reasons why he believes the **paradigms** plays a key role in defining the framework an dpointing the way to progress of normal science.
Rules, i.e., the methodlog, can be constant while the paradigm changes, or can be different for different groups that follow the same paradigm. Thus acceptance of roules by the scientific community is neither necessary nor sufficient for the progress of normal science.

# Anomalies and Scientific Discovery (ch.6)

An important **discovery** does not occur in a moment, but rather is a process of a change in our understanding of nature, typically with the following steps:

- Recognition of an anomaly for some time. An anomaly refers to boservational or experimental data that appear to conflict with the paradigm.
- Experimental and theoretical research to verify that it is a true anomaly.
- Modifying o rrejecting the pardigm in order to explain these. data

## An example of a discovery in physics

- In the 1800s, scientists thought all waves must propagate in a **medium**.
- For light, they imagine dan **ether** throughout space.
- However, experiments showed no change in the speed of light **c** when Earth moved through space -> an anomaly
- There were many iedas of how to explain the anomaly, but these confliced with othe rtheories or data.
- Finally, Einstein suggested another point of view: there is no ether, and **c** is a constant ( from Maxwell's Equations ) From this, he build the theory of special relativity ( with $E = mc^2$) which became a new paradigm for mechanics.

# Normal science and anomalies

- In practice, normal science ( or puzzle solving within the framework of the paradigm ) is an activity that is **very efficient at uncovering anomalies** (i.e puzzles that are difficult to solve) blah blah blah

# Crises (ch. 7-8)

- A **crisis** is a situation where the scientific community recognizes a **series problem** in explaining an anomaly.
- Then there ar estages similar to the stages of an anomaly. People will propose various solutions and modifications to the pardigm. until there are manylines of thought blah blah
- This may lead to a feeling in the scientific community that this anomaly may be more than simply a puzzle within current paradimg, its part of normal science. Instead, this becomes "extraordinary science"
- Then some scientists are mentally prepared to complete rejct the existing paradigm in feor of a new paradigm.
- "An idea whose line has come" - the time is ripe for acceptance of new ideas.

## An idea whose time has _not_ come

Sometimes in hisoory there have been good ieeas that the scientific oommunity whs not ready to accept.
- Aristarchus( 3rd century B.C.) proposed that **planets orbit the Sun ...** but at that time, the idea seemed complicated ( compared with the prevailing concept that palntez orbited the Earth) and there was too little evidence to support them.
- When Wegener(1912) proposed the idea of continental drift. he was ridiculed. While his main idea is now believed to be correct, his detailed mechanism (contineents plowing through ocena crust) was incorrect and was strongly criticized.
  
# Scientists welcomed new ideas ...

- Only when they recognized problems with the current paradigm, i.e.., **during a crisis**.
- "If it ain't broke, don't fix it"
- Kuhn's ideas were shocking ofr th ephilosophy of science. WHen the ideas of Aristarechus and wegeneer were rejected, the process and methods blah blah blah
